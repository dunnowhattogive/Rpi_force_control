## üöÄ Installation

### Quick Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/RPi_control.git
cd RPi_control

# 2. Run comprehensive setup
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# 3. Start the application
./manage.sh run
```

### Setup Options
```bash
./setup.sh    # Interactive setup with multiple options:
              # 1. Full installation (recommended)

*This project is specifically designed and tested on Raspberry Pi hardware with comprehensive Pi OS integration.*

**Note:**  
> **GPIO Library Change:**  
> This project now uses [gpiod](https://libgpiod.readthedocs.io/) for GPIO access instead of gpiozero.  
> Make sure your system has the `gpiod` Python package and the underlying system library installed.  
> See `requirements.txt` and the installation section for details.
