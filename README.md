## 🚀 Installation

### Quick Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/RPi_control.git
cd RPi_control

# 2. Run comprehensive setup
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# 3. Start the application
./manage.sh run
```

### Setup Options
```bash
./setup.sh    # Interactive setup with multiple options:
              # 1. Full installation (recommended)
              # 2. Fix existing installation  
              # 3. Virtual environment only
              # 4. Service configuration only
```

## 🎮 Usage

### Starting the Application

```bash
# Manual GUI start
./manage.sh run

# Service management
./manage.sh start      # Start as background service
./manage.sh stop       # Stop service
./manage.sh status     # Check service status
./manage.sh logs       # View live logs

# Auto-boot configuration
./manage.sh enable     # Enable auto-start on boot
./manage.sh disable    # Disable auto-start
```

### System Management

```bash
# System operations
./manage.sh fix        # Fix common issues
./manage.sh update     # Update packages
./manage.sh test       # Run functionality tests
./manage.sh validate   # Validate configuration

# Monitoring
./manage.sh monitor    # System resource monitor
./manage.sh temp       # Check Pi temperature
./manage.sh backup     # Backup configuration
```

## 🔧 Script Structure

The system now uses only two main scripts:

### **Primary Scripts**
- **`setup.sh`** - Complete installation and configuration
- **`manage.sh`** - All system management operations  
- **`rpi_control.py`** - Main application
- **`functionality_check.py`** - System validation

### **Compatibility Scripts**
- **`start_gui.sh`** - Redirects to `manage.sh run` (for backward compatibility)

### **Configuration Files**
- **`rpicontrol.service`** - Systemd service definition
- **`requirements.txt`** - Python package dependencies
- **`system_config.json`** - Application configuration (created during setup)
